Quantum Circuit Design Search

This repository contains the implementations of the reinforcement learning search strategy discussed in the paper, "Quantum Circuit Design Search." 
The archive version of the paper can be found at this [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04046.pdf). This study explores search strategies for the design of the parameterized quantum circuits.
